      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the seventh article in my series of articles on Python for NLP. In my previous article, I explained how to perform topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix factorization. We used the Scikit-Learn library to perform topic modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we will explore TextBlob, which is another extremely powerful NLP library for Python. TextBlob is built upon NLTK and provides an easy to use interface to the NLTK library. We will see how TextBlob can be used to perform a variety of NLP tasks ranging from parts-of-speech tagging to sentiment analysis, and language translation to text classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "The detailed download instructions for the library can be found at the official link. I would suggest that you install the TextBlob library as well as the sample corpora.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the gist of the instructions linked above, but be sure to check the official documentation for more instructions on installing if you need it:\n",
      "\n",
      "$ pip install -U textblob\n",
      "\n",
      "And to install the corpora:\n",
      "\n",
      "$ python -m textblob.download_corpora\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's now see the different functionalities of the TextBlob library.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tokenization\n",
      "\n",
      "Tokenization refers to splitting a large paragraph into sentences or words. Typically, a token refers to a word in a text document. Tokenization is pretty straight forward with TextBlob. All you have to do is import the\n",
      "TextBlob\n",
      "\n",
      "object from the\n",
      "textblob\n",
      "\n",
      "library, pass it the document that you want to tokenize, and then use the\n",
      "sentences\n",
      "\n",
      "and\n",
      "words\n",
      "\n",
      "attributes to get the tokenized sentences and attributes. Let's see this in action:\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step is to import the\n",
      "TextBlob\n",
      "\n",
      "object:\n",
      "\n",
      "from textblob import TextBlob\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, you need to define a string that contains the text of the document. We will create string that contains the first paragraph of the Wikipedia article on artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "document = (\"In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), \\\n",
      "\n",
      "sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence \\\n",

      "\n",
      "human minds, such as \\\"learning\\\" and \\\"problem solving\\\".[2]\")\n",

      "The next step is to pass this document as a parameter to the\n",
